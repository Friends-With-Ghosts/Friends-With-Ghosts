What are we but containers for thoughts? For emotions? What meaning do these have? All that we see before us will one day be gone, nothing but dust clinging to the feet of those that will come long after us. One day, none will care to know our names or that we even existed.

Noâ€¦ Our successors will know nothing of us.

That is not to say that we will not leave behind a legacy.
