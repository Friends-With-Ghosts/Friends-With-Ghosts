The beyond is the crowning glory of all that is dark and twisted. In this place there is no burning light -- there is only the numbing pain of shadow. Its voices cry out, amalgamated as one, but split into many. 

Our meagre mortal minds cannot understand its complexity. We cannot appreciate its beauty. This unnatural trespass is our legacy. It is our crime.
