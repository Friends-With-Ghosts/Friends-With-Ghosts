The things that lie in wait beyond our perception are closer to us than one might think. We are nothing but fallacies of our true selves that contain infinity. Our souls are endless, but they have been trapped within prisons of flesh. They buckle under the weight of our human impulses but they do not fall. No. They are weighed down but they are not crushed. 

They toil for years but then in the release of death they are returned to that screaming cacophony they always dreamed of joining once again.
