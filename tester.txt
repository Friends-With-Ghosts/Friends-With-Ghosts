Once a human dies, typically their soul is cast into the darkness of the space between 
realities to wait for rebirth. Every so often, a soul is kept on earth in suffering as 
its humanity is stripped away. The mind that accompanied it in life is still there. Its 
human memories and feelings are still lurking under the surface, but the soul wants to 
be free.
